You have to give the name of the matrix file you want to calculate.(like 5x5mat.txt,10x10mat.txt)
I keep my output results in file "outputforpy.txt" you can change it if you want.

If you work on other matrices you can benefit from here

There should be a comma between the lines because that's how it is defined in my code.
